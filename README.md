### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about writing code. One of the principal reasons I love coding is the impact it has on people.

I have had the opportunity to take on various roles in my career, ranging from software developer to technical lead. Currently, I'm a senior software engineer at Apptegy, where I focus on the backend and application architecture. During my time at Apptegy, I had the opportunity to author and create a Ruby framework that simplifies the creation of microservices with gRPC. Additionally, I am currently working on migrating microservices to a robust monolith.

I am a team player who enjoys collaborating with individuals who are smarter than I am, learning from them, and contributing my skills to the team. I firmly believe in the values of respect and humility, acknowledging that we can always learn new things from everyone. I also place great importance on teamwork, as I believe it is the key to achieving collective goals.

As an enthusiastic software engineer, I am dedicated to creating positive impacts through code. I am always eager to explore new opportunities and contribute to meaningful projects.
