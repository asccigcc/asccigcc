### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer that loves writing code. One of the principal reasons that I love coding is the effect that it has on people.

I had the opportunity to be part of different roles in my career from software developer to technical lead. Currently, I'm a senior software engineer on Apptegy working on the backend and the application architecture. In Apptegy, I had the opportunity to author and create a Ruby framework that simplifies the creation of microservices with gRPC, and also currently, I'm working on migrating microservices to a majestic monolith.

I'm a team player, I like to work with people smarter than I am and learn from them, I like to be part of teams and share my skills with them. I believe in the values of respect and humility; I believe that always we learn new things from all people and I believe in teamwork; the only way to reach goals is by playing as a team member.

I am an enthusiastic software engineer dedicated to creating positive impacts through code. I am always excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to meaningful projects.
